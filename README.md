# PHP Starter Project - (Web Development College Subject)

This project is a start to PHP development. It has small implementations of logins, sessions, DB access, and other stuff.

Please __don't use__ code from here, as it doesn't follow any good practices guide at all. This can lead to serious security leaks to your project.

Feel free to use anything you want from here, if you find it useful.
