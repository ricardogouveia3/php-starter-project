# PHP Starter Project - (Web Development College Subject)

This project is a start to PHP development. It has small implementations of logins, sessions, DB access, and other stuff.

Please __don't use__ code from here, as it doesn't follow any good practices guide at all. This include security leaks like the password on 'connect_php.php' being public.

Feel free to use anything you want from here, if you find it useful.
